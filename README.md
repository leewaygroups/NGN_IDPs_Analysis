# An Analysis of Internal Displacement in Selected States in North West and Central Zones of Nigeria

## Motivation
In recent years, Nigeria has seen a surge in the number of internally displaced persons especially in the northern part of the country. While the affected population have one thing in common - being internally displaced and vulnerable, they may have dissimilar characteristics in terms of demographic and geographic distribution and very importantly reasons for their placement. I believe that a better understanding of these is necessary for all stakeholders involved in delivering humanitarian services to the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and most importantly to all the tiers of the national government.


Having set the general context of this discourse, the specific context is the North West and North Central zones of Nigeria. 

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to glean some insight about the IDPs in the North West and North Central zones of Nigeria by asking some specific questions and seeking answers using a dataset collected by the United Nations International Organisation for Migration (IOM).

Nigeria consists of six(6) geopolitical zones. The scope of this analysis is limited to the two zones mentioned earlier as those were the only zones covered in the dataset provided.

### Dataset Description 
####  Title:
Nigeria Displacement Data - North Central & West Zones - Location Assessment 

#### Publisher:
International Organisation for Migration (IOM) The dataset cover the period of 4 September - 16 October 2019 and includes the states mostly affected by displacement including Benue,Nasarawa and Plateau in North Central; Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara in North West.

## Summary of results drawn from the analysis
IDPs when present in a state tend to be dispersed across LGAs, women tend to make up more of the IDP population, and communal clashes is the leading reason for displacement in the two zones considered and this is also true in some states.
